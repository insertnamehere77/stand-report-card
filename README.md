# About
The stand report card is a web toy to grade images as if they were [stands](https://jojowiki.com/Stand) from the manga/anime Jojo's Bizarre Adventures. It produces a stat diagram reminiscent of the show. It's hosted [here](https://stand-report-card.herokuapp.com) and was built using React. It's a bit rough around the edges, but functional.
